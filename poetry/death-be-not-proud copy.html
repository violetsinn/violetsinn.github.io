    <h2> No Man is an island (Meditation XVII)</h2>
    <h3> By John Donne </h3>

    <h3> Modern Version</h3>
    <p>
        Death, be not proud, though some have called thee</br>
        Mighty and dreadful, for thou are not so;<br>
        For those whom thou think'st thou dost overthrow<br>
        Die not, poor Death, nor yet canst thou kill me.<br>
        <br>
        From rest and sleep, which but thy pictures be,<br>
        Much pleasure; then from thee much more must flow,<br>
        And soonest our best men with thee do go,<br>
        Rest of their bones, and soul's delivery.<br>
        <br>
        Thou'art slave to fate, chance, kings, and desperate men,<br>
        And dost with poison, war, and sickness dwell,<br>
        And poppy'or charms can make us sleep as well<br>
        And better than thy stroke; why swell'st thou then?<br>
        <br>
        One short sleep past, we wake eternally,<br>
        And death shall be no more; Death, thou shalt die.<br>
    </p>

    <h3> Original Version</h3>
    <p>No man is an Iland, intire of itselfe;<br>
        every man is a peece of the Continent, <br>
        a part of the maine;<br>
        if a Clod bee washed away by the Sea, <br>
        Europe is the lesse, <br>
        as well as if a Promontorie were, <br>
        as well as if a Manor of thy friends <br>
        or of thine owne were; <br>
        any mans death diminishes me,<br>
        because I am involved in Mankinde;<br>
        And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; <br>
        It tolls for thee.
    </p>
