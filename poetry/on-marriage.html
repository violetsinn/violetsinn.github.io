    <h2> On Marriage </h2>
    <h3> By Kahlil Gibran </h3>
    <p>
        Then Almitra spoke again and said, And<br>
        what of Marriage, master?<br>
        And he answered saying:<br>
        You were born together, and together you<br>
        shall be forevermore.<br>
        You shall be together when the white<br>
        wings of death scatter your days.<br>
        Ay, you shall be together even in the<br>
        silent memory of God.<br>
        But let there be spaces in your togetherness,<br>
        And let the winds of the heavens dance<br>
        between you.<br>
        <br>
        Love one another, but make not a bond<br>
        of love:<br>
        Let it rather be a moving sea between<br>
        the shores of your souls.<br>
        Fill each other's cup but drink not from<br>
        one cup.<br>
        Give one another of your bread but eat<br>
        not from the same loaf.<br>
        Sing and dance together and be joyous,<br>
        but let each one of you be alone,<br>
        Even as the strings of a lute are alone<br>
        though they quiver with the same music.<br>
        <br>
        Give your hearts, but not into each<br>
        other's keeping.<br>
        For only the hand of Life can contain<br>
        your hearts.<br>
        And stand together yet not too near<br>
        together:<br>
        For the pillars of the temple stand apart,<br>
        And the oak tree and the cypress grow<br>
        not in each other's shadow.<br>
    </p>
