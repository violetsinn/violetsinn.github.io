    <h2> On Marriage </h2>
    <h3> By Kahlil Gibran </h3>
    <p>
        Then said Almitra, Speak to us of Love.<br>
        And he raised his head and looked upon<br>
        the people, and there fell a stillness upon<br>
        them. And with a great voice he said:<br>
        When love beckons to you, follow him,<br>
        Though his ways are hard and steep.<br>
        And when his wings enfold you yield to him,<br>
        Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.<br>
        And when he speaks to you believe in him,<br>
        Though his voice may shatter your dreams<br>
        as the north wind lays waste the garden.<br>
        <br>
        For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you.<br>
        Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.<br>
        Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,<br>
        So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.<br>
        <br>
        Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.<br>
        He threshes you to make you naked.<br>
        He sifts you to free you from your husks.<br>
        He grinds you to whiteness.<br>
        He kneads you until you are pliant;<br>
        And then he assigns you to his sacred fire,<br>
        That you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.<br>
        <br>
        All these things shall love do unto you<br>
        that you may know the secrets of your<br>
        heart, and in that knowledge become a<br>
        fragment of Life's heart.<br>
        <br>
        But if in your fear you would seek only<br>
        love's peace and love's pleasure,<br>
        Then it is better for you that you cover<br>
        your nakedness and pass out of love's<br>
        threshing-floor,<br>
        Into the seasonless world where you<br>
        shall laugh, but not all of your laughter,<br>
        and weep, but not all of your tears.<br>
        <br>
        Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.<br>
        Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;<br>
        For love is sufficient unto love.<br>
        <br>
        When you love you should not say,<br>
        “God is in my heart,” but rather, “I am in the heart of God.”<br>
        And think not you can direct the course<br>
        of love, for love, if it finds you worthy,<br>
        directs your course.<br>
        <br>
        Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.<br>
        But if you love and must needs have<br>
        desires, let these be your desires:<br>
        To melt and be like a running brook<br>
        that sings its melody to the night.<br>
        To know the pain of too much tenderness.<br>
        To be wounded by your own understanding of love;<br>
        And to bleed willingly and joyfully.<br>
        To wake at dawn with a winged heart<br>
        and give thanks for another day of loving;<br>
        To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;<br>
        To return home at eventide with gratitude;<br>
        And then to sleep with a prayer for the
        beloved in your heart and a song of praise
        upon your lips.
