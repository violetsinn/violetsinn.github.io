    <h2> On Marriage </h2>
    <h3> By Kahlil Gibran </h3>
    <p>
        Then a hermit, who visited the city once<br>
        a year, came forth and said, Speak to us of<br>
        Pleasure.<br>
        And he answered, saying:<br>
        Pleasure is a freedom-song,<br>
        But it is not freedom.<br>
        It is the blossoming of your desires,<br>
        But it is not their fruit.<br>
        It is a depth calling unto a height,<br>
        But it is not the deep nor the high.<br>
        It is the caged taking wing,<br>
        But it is not space encompassed.<br>
        Ay, in very truth, pleasure is a freedom-<br>
        song.<br>
        And I fain would have you sing it with<br>
        fullness of heart; yet I would not have you<br>
        lose your hearts in the singing.<br>
<br>
        Some of your youth seek pleasure as if it<br>
        were all, and they are judged and rebuked.<br>
        I would not judge nor rebuke them. I<br>
        would have them seek.<br>
        For they shall find pleasure, but not her<br>
        alone;<br>
        Seven are her sisters, and the least of them<br>
        is more beautiful than pleasure.<br>
        Have you not heard of the man who was<br>
        digging in the earth for roots and found a<br>
        treasure?<br>
<br>
        And some of your elders remember<br>
        pleasures with regret like wrongs com-<br>
        mitted in drunkenness.<br>
        But regret is the beclouding of the mind<br>
        and not its chastisement.<br>
        They should remember their pleasures with<br>
        gratitude, as they would the harvest of a<br>
        summer.<br>
        Yet if it comforts them to regret, let them<br>
        be comforted.<br>
<br>
        And there are among you those who are<br>
        neither young to seek nor old to remember;<br>
        And in their fear of seeking and remem-<br>
        bering they shun all pleasures, lest they<br>
        neglect the spirit or offend against it.<br>
        But even in their foregoing is their<br>
        pleasure.<br>
        And thus they too find a treasure though<br>
        they dig for roots with quivering hands.<br>
        But tell me, who is he that can offend the<br>
        spirit?<br>
        Shall the nightingale offend the stillness of<br>
        the night, or the firefly the stars?<br>
        And shall your flame or your smoke<br>
        burden the wind?<br>
        Think you the spirit is a still pool which<br>
        you can trouble with a staff?<br>
<br>
        Oftentimes in denying yourself pleasure<br>
        you do but store the desire in the recesses<br>
        of your being.<br>
        Who knows but that which seems omitted<br>
        today, waits for tomorrow?<br>
        Even your body knows its heritage and<br>
        its rightful need and will not be deceived.<br>
        And your body is the harp of your soul,<br>
        And it is yours to bring forth sweet<br>
        music from it or confused sounds.<br>

        And now you ask in your heart, “How<br>
        shall we distinguish that which is good in<br>
        pleasure from that which is not good?”<br>
        Go to your fields and your gardens, and<br>
        you shall learn that it is the pleasure of<br>
        the bee to gather honey of the flower,<br>
        But it is also the pleasure of the flower<br>
        to yield its honey to the bee.<br>
        For to the bee a flower is a fountain of<br>
        life,<br>
        And to the flower a bee is a messenger of<br>
        love,<br>
        And to both, bee and flower, the giving<br>
        and the receiving of pleasure is a need and<br>
        an ecstasy.<br>
<br>
        People of Orphalese, be in your pleasures like the flowers and the bees.
