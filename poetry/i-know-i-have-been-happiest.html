    <h2> I Know I Have Been Happiest </h2>
    <h3> By Dorothy Parker </h3>
    <p>
        I know I have been happiest at your side;<br>
        But what is done, is done, and all's to be.<br>
        And small the good, to linger dolefully,-<br>
        Gaily it lived, and gallantly it died.<br>
        I will not make you songs of hearts denied,<br>
        And you, being man, would have no tears of me,<br>
        And should I offer you fidelity,<br>
        You'd be, I think, a little terrified.<br>
        Yet this the need of woman, this her curse:<br>
        To range her little gifts, and give, and give,<br>
        Because the throb of giving's sweet to bear.<br>
        To you, who never begged me vows or verse,<br>
        My gift shall be my absence, while I live;<br>
        But after that, my dear, I cannot swear.<br>
    </p>
