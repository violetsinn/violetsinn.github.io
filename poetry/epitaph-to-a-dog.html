    <h2> Epitaph to a Dog </h2>
    <h3> By Lord Byron </h3>
    <p>
        When some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,<br>
        Unknown to Glory but upheld by Birth,<br>
        <br>
        The sculptor's art exhausts the pomp of woe,<br>
        And storied urns record who rests below:<br>
        <br>
        When all is done, upon the Tomb is seen<br>
        Not what he was, but what he should have been.<br>
        <br>
        But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,<br>
        The first to welcome, foremost to defend,<br>
        <br>
        Whose honest heart is still his Master's own,<br>
        Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,<br>
        <br>
        Unhonour'd falls, unnotic'd all his worth,<br>
        Deny'd in heaven the Soul he held on Earth:<br>
        <br>
        While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,<br>
        And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.<br>
        <br>
        Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,<br>
        Debas'd by slavery, or corrupt by power,<br>
        <br>
        Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,<br>
        Degraded mass of animated dust!<br>
        <br>
        Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,<br>
        Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!<br>
        <br>
        By nature vile, ennobled but by name,<br>
        Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.<br>
        <br>
        Ye! who behold perchance this simple urn,<br>
        Pass on, it honors none you wish to mourn.<br>
        <br>
        To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;<br>
        I never knew but oneâ€”and here he lies.<br>
    </p>
