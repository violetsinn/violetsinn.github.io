		<h2> Epitaph to a Dog </h2>
		<h3> By Lord Byron </h3>
		<p>
			When some proud Son of Man returns to Earth,<br>
            Unknown to Glory but upheld by Birth,<br>
            The sculptor's art exhausts the pomp of woe,<br>
            And storied urns record who rests below:<br>
            When all is done, upon the Tomb is seen<br>
            Not what he was, but what he should have been.<br>
            But the poor Dog, in life the firmest friend,<br>
            The first to welcome, foremost to defend,<br>
            Whose honest heart is still his Master's own,<br>
            Who labours, fights, lives, breathes for him alone,<br>
            Unhonour'd falls, unnotic'd all his worth,<br>
            Deny'd in heaven the Soul he held on earth:<br>
            While man, vain insect! hopes to be forgiven,<br>
            And claims himself a sole exclusive heaven.<br>
            Oh man! thou feeble tenant of an hour,<br>
            Debas'd by slavery, or corrupt by power,<br>
            Who knows thee well, must quit thee with disgust,<br>
            Degraded mass of animated dust!<br>
            Thy love is lust, thy friendship all a cheat,<br>
            Thy tongue hypocrisy, thy heart deceit!<br>
            By nature vile, ennobled but by name,<br>
            Each kindred brute might bid thee blush for shame.<br>
            Ye! who behold perchance this simple urn,<br>
            Pass on, it honors none you wish to mourn.<br>
            To mark a friend's remains these stones arise;<br>
            I never knew but oneâ€”and here he lies.<br>
