    <h2> Purposely Ungrammatical Love Song </h2>
    <h3> By Dorothy Parker </h3>
    <p>
        There's many and many, and not so far,<br>
        Is willing to dry my tears away;<br>
        There's many to tell me what you are,<br>
        And never a lie to all they say.<br>

        It's little the good to hide my head,<br>
        It's never the use to bar my door;<br>
        There's many as counts the tears I shed,<br>
        There's mourning hearts for my heart is<br>

        There's honester eyes than your blue eyes,<br>
        There's better a mile than such as you.<br>
        But when did I say that I was wise,<br>
        And when did I hope that you were true?<br>
    </p>
