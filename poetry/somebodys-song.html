    <h2> Somebody's Song </h2>
    <h3> By Dorothy Parker </h3>
    <p>
        This is what I vow;<br>
        He shall have my heart to keep,<br>
        Sweetly will we stir and sleep,<br>
        All the years, as now.<br>
        Swift the measured sands may run;<br>
        Love like this is never done;<br>
        He and I are welded one:<br>
        This is what I vow.<br>
        This is what I pray:<br>
        Keep him by me tenderly;<br>
        Keep him sweet in pride of me,<br>
        Ever and a day;<br>
        Keep me from the old distress;<br>
        Let me, for our happiness,<br>
        Be the one to love the less:<br>
        This is what I pray.<br>
        This is what I know:<br>
        Lovers' oaths are thin as rain;<br>
        Love's a harbinger of pain-<br>
        Would it were not so!<br>
        Ever is my heart a-thirst,<br>
        Ever is my love accurst;<br>
        He is neither last nor first-<br>
        This is what I know.
    </p>
