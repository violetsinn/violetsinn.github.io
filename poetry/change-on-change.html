		<h2>Change on Change</h2>
		<h3>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h3>
		<p>
			Three months ago, the stream did flow,<br>
			The lilies bloomed along the edge;<br>
			And we were lingering to and fro,—<br>
			Where none will track thee in this snow,<br>
			Along the stream, beside the hedge.<br>
			Ah! sweet, be free to come and go;<br>
			For if I do not hear thy foot,<br>
			The frozen river is as mute,—<br>
			The flowers have dried down to the root;<br>
			And why, since these be changed since May,<br>
			Shouldst thou change less than they?<br>
			<br>
			And slow, slow as the winter snow,<br>
			The tears have drifted to mine eyes;<br>
			And my two cheeks, three months ago,<br>
			Set blushing at thy praises so,<br>
			Put paleness on for a disguise.<br>
			Ah! sweet, be free to praise and go;<br>
			For if my face is turned to pale,<br>
			It was thine oath that first did fail,—<br>
			It was thy love proved false and frail!<br>
			And why, since these be changed, I trow,<br>
			Should I change less than thou?
