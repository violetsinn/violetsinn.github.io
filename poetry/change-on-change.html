			<h2>Change on Change</h2>
			<h3>by Elizabeth Barrett Browning</h3>
			<p>
				Three months ago, the stream did flow,<br>
				The lilies bloomed along the edge;<br>
				And we were lingering to and fro,—<br>
				Where none will track thee in this snow,<br>
				Along the stream, beside the hedge.<br>
				Ah! sweet, be free to come and go;<br>
				For if I do not hear thy foot,<br>
				The frozen river is as mute,—<br>
				The flowers have dried down to the root;<br>
				And why, since these be changed since May,<br>
				Shouldst thou change less than they?<br>
				<br>
				And slow, slow as the winter snow,<br>
				The tears have drifted to mine eyes;<br>
				And my two cheeks, three months ago,<br>
				Set blushing at thy praises so,<br>
				Put paleness on for a disguise.<br>
				Ah! sweet, be free to praise and go;<br>
				For if my face is turned to pale,<br>
				It was thine oath that first did fail,—<br>
				It was thy love proved false and frail!<br>
				And why, since these be changed, I trow,<br>
				Should I change less than thou?
			</p>

			<p> Initial Thoughts: I first read this poem in October 2025, and it reminded me of a breakup I experienced nearly a year ago. The opening lines are almost childlike in the way they express joy and wonder at simple things like running water, flowers, and snow, evoking memories of the innocence and naivete of a new love. I admire Browning's attitude towards love itself, expressed in line 6, where she discusses her desire to free her lover rather than possess them. At first, her perspective seemed incredibly mature and idealistic. I am amused, however, by how quickly that idealism turns into realism, when she asks - almost sarcastically - why her lover should stay the same if even flowers don't. In the end, I relate to her rightful anger that her lover's emotions were "false and frail", highlighting the painful gap between idealized love and human imperfection.</p>
