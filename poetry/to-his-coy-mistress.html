    <h2> To His Coy Mistress </h2>
    <h3> By Andrew Marvell </h3>
    <p>
        Had we but world enough and time,<br>
        This coyness, lady, were no crime.<br>
        We would sit down, and think which way<br>
        To walk, and pass our long love's day.<br>
        Thou by the Indian Ganges' side<br>
        Shouldst rubies find; I by the tide<br>
        Of Humber would complain. I would<br>
        Love you ten years before the flood,<br>
        And you should, if you please, refuse<br>
        Till the conversion of the Jews.<br>
        My vegetable love should grow<br>
        Vaster than empires and more slow;<br>
        An hundred years should go to praise<br>
        Thine eyes, and on thy forehead gaze;<br>
        Two hundred to adore each breast,<br>
        But thirty thousand to the rest;<br>
        An age at least to every part,<br>
        And the last age should show your heart.<br>
        For, lady, you deserve this state,<br>
        Nor would I love at lower rate.<br>
        But at my back I always hear<br>
        Time's wing√®d chariot hurrying near;<br>
        And yonder all before us lie<br>
        Deserts of vast eternity.<br>
        Thy beauty shall no more be found;<br>
        Nor, in thy marble vault, shall sound<br>
        My echoing song; then worms shall try<br>
        That long-preserved virginity,<br>
        And your quaint honour turn to dust,<br>
        And into ashes all my lust;<br>
        The grave's a fine and private place,<br>
        But none, I think, do there embrace.<br>
        Now therefore, while the youthful hue<br>
        Sits on thy skin like morning dew,<br>
        And while thy willing soul transpires<br>
        At every pore with instant fires,<br>
        Now let us sport us while we may,<br>
        And now, like amorous birds of prey,<br>
        Rather at once our time devour<br>
        Than languish in his slow-chapped power.<br>
        Let us roll all our strength and all<br>
        Our sweetness up into one ball,<br>
        And tear our pleasures with rough strife<br>
        Through the iron gates of life:<br>
        Thus, though we cannot make our sun<br>
        Stand still, yet we will make him run.<br>
    </p>
