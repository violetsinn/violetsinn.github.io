    <h2> The Sun Rising </h2>
    <h3> By John Donne </h3>
    <p>
        Busy old fool, unruly Sun,<br>
        Why dost thou thus,<br>
        Through windows, and through curtains, call on us?<br>
        Must to thy motions lovers' seasons run?<br>
        Saucy pedantic wretch, go chide<br>
        Late school-boys and sour prentices,<br>
        Go tell court-huntsmen that the king will ride,<br>
        Call country ants to harvest offices;<br>
        Love, all alike, no season knows nor clime,<br>
        Nor hours, days, months, which are the rags of time.<br>
        <br>
        Thy beams so reverend, and strong<br>
        Why shouldst thou think?<br>
        I could eclipse and cloud them with a wink,<br>
        But that I would not lose her sight so long.<br>
        If her eyes have not blinded thine,<br>
        Look, and to-morrow late tell me,<br>
        Whether both th' Indias of spice and mine<br>
        Be where thou left'st them, or lie here with me.<br>
        Ask for those kings whom thou saw'st yesterday,<br>
        And thou shalt hear, “All here in one bed lay.”<br>
        <br>
        She's all states, and all princes I;<br>
        Nothing else is;<br>
        Princes do but play us; compared to this,<br>
        All honour's mimic, all wealth alchemy.<br>
        Thou, Sun, art half as happy as we,<br>
        In that the world's contracted thus;<br>
        Thine age asks ease, and since thy duties be<br>
        To warm the world, that’s done in warming us.<br>
        Shine here to us, and thou art everywhere;<br>
        This bed thy center is, these walls thy sphere.<br>
    </p>
